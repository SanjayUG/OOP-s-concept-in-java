# OOP-s-concept-in-java

## OOPs(Object Oriented Programming):
- OOP is a powerful paradigm that allows you to design and organize the code in a more modular and efficient way.
- It is a Class and Object based relationship.
- Class: A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects.
- Object: An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, it inherits all the characteristics defined in the class.
- OOP encourages code reusability. Instead of duplicating code, we should extract common functionality into methods or base classes.

## 4 pillers of Object Oriented Programming
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## 1. Encapsulation
- Encapsulation refers to bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit.
- It helps to hide the internal details of an object and exposes only what’s necessary. Access modifiers (like private, protected, and public) control the visibility of class members.


## 2. Abstraction
- Abstraction allows you to create simplified representations of complex systems.
- By defining abstract classes or interfaces, you can hide implementation details and provide a clear contract for other classes to follow.


## 3. Inheritance
- It is a subclass inherits the properties and behaviors of the superclass.
- It promotes code reuse and establishes an “is-a” relationship.


## 4. Polymorphism
- Polymorphism means "many forms".
- It allows you to use a single interface (method or operator) to represent different types of objects.
- Method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) and method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass) can be implemented here.
